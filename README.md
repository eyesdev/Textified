# Textified

<img src='assets\example.png'>
A simple text editor written in python using tkinter.
<br>

This is an **experiment**. This isn't supposed to be any good stuff.

# How to run?

## Windows

Run the `textified.exe` included in the [releases section](https://github.com/jtgrJakub/Textified/releases).
**This will include a lot of files because this was made in python and needs some packages. Run the textified.exe and nothing else.**
